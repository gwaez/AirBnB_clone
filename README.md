## Project Description
Welcome to the Airbnb Clone project! This is the initial phase where we focused on the backend development, coupled with a console application using the cmd module in Python.

Generated data (Python objects) are stored in a JSON file and can be accessed using the JSON module in Python.

## Description of the Command Interpreter:
Our command-line interface mirrors the Bash shell, specifically tailored for the Airbnb website. The console serves as the frontend, allowing users to interact with the Python OOP backend.

Some available commands include:
- show
- create
- update
- destroy
- count

You can perform various actions such as creating new objects, retrieving objects, performing operations, updating attributes, and destroying objects.

## Getting Started
